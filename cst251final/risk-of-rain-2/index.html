                        <h4>Why You Should Play.</h4>
                        <p>Quarantine has got everyone a little bit (or a lot a bit) stressed, and sometimes catharsis is the only way you can unwind if outside is unavalable. A fast paced third-person shooter mixed with a classic rouge-like is an excellent way to spend a few hours. With modes ranging from casual to challenging, there is something for anyone who just wants to zone out and play. The game is fairly priced at 20 bucks on the Steam Market, and provides hours of entertainment, both for people on their own, or with up to 3 friends. The game is also easilly modable, from simple cosmetic additions to game mechanic changes, you can customize your gameplay in a variety of ways. Mods that share items amongst all players, or remove the player cap, and more make this game feel fresh whenever you want.</p>

                        <h4>Personal Experiance or: How I Learned to Praise RNG-Jesus</h4>
                        <p>This game is one of my favorites. It's simplicity and pleasing visuals initially drew me to it, and after playing for a while, I found I really enjoyed it. The first time I played I didn't get very far, but run after run I improved. Until finally, after 6-ish hours of gameplay, I got it. The God Run. Oh, when you get that run, you really get it. A strong start with good phase 1 items, followed by excellent luck on Boss Teleporter items, filled my heart with glee. As the hours passed, and I preogressed, I grew stronger, and stronger. Bosses died in seconds, elite enemies disintigrated in droves, but then I found it. A lovely item named Gesture of The Drowned, mixed with a usable that lets you rain lightning down upon on target, and oh it was gloriouse. All I had to do was simply look around, and things that where in my crosshairs died. I found 4 other Gestures, and soon, it was lightning time all the time. You may think that surely the game is over at this point, that I had won. Incorrect, many a run has ended due to my own huberis and greed, and this one was no diffirent. Instead of entering the Oblisk and winning, I decided I wanted more. I kept going, but I had lost the power curve. The enemies where getting stronger than I could handle, and I wansn't finding enough of the items I needed to stay above the curve. So, at the dawn of the 27th stage, I perished. It was an experiance that I can deffinetaly recomend! </p>
